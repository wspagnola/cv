# Notes on LaTeX Resume
There are several packages on CTAN for making resumes.  The moderncv package is fairly popular.  However, in addition to prefering a more classic design, I wanted more flexibility while creating my own resume.  I highly encouraged intermediate and advanced LaTeX users to design their own resumes.  Rather than starting from scratch, you can build off the templates available on [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv).
